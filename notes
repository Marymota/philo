After a long while, thanks to some great help
I was able to figure out what the problems were

All my program run well exept when the first thread taken was 
philo->2 instead of philo->1, at that point my philo one would die
and then keep running for a long while what was obvious not normal.

After that It was called to my attention that just philo one died
all the time.
For some strange reason I thought that was perfectly normal...
After a printf in the death() function it was visible that only philo->id 1 
was entering that function.
So I had to arrange the monitor function that until that point was only
observing one.. but declare death as soon as sim->die turn to 1;

After that the time of death keep being printed 1ms after other actions
were taken and the problem was that I was printing
"current time - philo->time of last meal", the formula I use to
compare if is more than "time o die".
The one I should be printing is "current time - time of start";

After that everything seems to be OK XP
